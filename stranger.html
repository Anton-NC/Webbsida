        <p class="info">1.The show was created by twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, got to do the coolest thing ever and work together on an epic TV show that probably includes a lot of things they grew up doing together (like eating Eggos and playing Dungeons and Dragons). The two worked on a few other projects together before ST – like the movie “Hidden” and some other thrillers. But, they came up with the idea for ST based on the question: “What if Steven Spielberg were to direct a Stephen King book?” Obviously, they nailed it. 8.7/10 stars </p>
       
     <h2> The show is based on a real time travel project.</h2>
     <p> There aren’t any transdimensional horror-beasts rampaging through quiet suburban towns (that we know of), but Stranger Things is based on real conspiracy theories about the United States government conducting reality-bending experiments on children. Specifically, the Montauk Project, which has been referenced in other fiction from Lost to Thomas Pynchon’s novel Bleeding Edge. Much of what Eleven experiences in the laboratory corresponds to the alleged events of the Montauk Project. The show was also initially called Montauk and set on the far edge of the Long Island peninsula. (Montauk was also the inspiration for the town in Jaws, another story of a monster menacing a small community, and one of many Spielberg movies that inspired Stranger Things.) </p>
     <h3> The show was almost an anothology series. </h3> 
      <p> The Stranger Things that we know almost didn’t come to be. The Duffer brothers meant for it to kick off with a monster-centric flash of 1980s nostalgia, but then they wanted it to tell new eerie tales and progress through the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and then 2020 in a final season that would air in 2020. The show would have said goodbye to Eleven, Dustin, Will, Mike, Lucas, and the rest of the cast after the first season. Luckily, they realized how special the team they’d assembled was and chose to keep focusing on their original story. </p>
